        'Safe sun exposure is essential for optimal health, but incorrect exposure can raise your risk of skin cancer while not providing any health benefits. Sunburn should be avoided at all cost.',
        'It\'s important to determine the ideal times of year for safe and effective sun exposure, and avoid exposure during times that UVB rays are not present.',
        'The skin around your eyes and your face is typically much thinner than other areas on your body and is a relatively small surface area so will not contribute much to vitamin D production. It is strongly recommended to protect this fragile area of your body as is at a much higher risk for cosmetic photo damage and premature wrinkling.',
        'Due to the physics and wavelength of UVB rays it will only penetrate the atmosphere when the sun is above an angle of about 50° from the horizon. When the sun is lower than 50°, the ozone layer reflects the UVB-rays but lets through the longer UVA-rays.'

        'While sunlight is composed of about 1,500 wavelengths, UVB is the only wavelength that will produce vitamin D when hitting unexposed skin. ',
        'A growing body of evidence shows that vitamin D plays a crucial role in disease prevention and maintaining optimal health. There are about 30,000 genes in your body, and vitamin D affects nearly 3,000 of them, as well as vitamin D receptors located throughout your body.',
        'If you  ever develop a sunburn it is important to realize that aloe vera is one of the best remedies to help repair your skin as it is loaded with powerful glyconutrients that accelerate healing. Ideally, it is best to use the gel from a fresh plant, but there are commercial products available that have active aloe in them.',
        'Vitamin D3 is an oil soluble steroid hormone that forms when your skin is exposed to UVB radiation from the sun. When UVB strikes the surface of your skin, your skin converts a cholesterol derivative into vitamin D3.',
        'It takes up to 48 hours for vitamin D3 to be absorbed into your bloodstream to elevate your vitamin D levels.',
        'If you are a fairly light skinned individual that tends to burn, you will want to limit your initial exposure to a few minutes, especially if it is in the middle of summer.<br><br>If it is early or late in the season and/or you are a dark skinned individual, you could likely safely have 30 minutes on your initial exposure. ',
        'UVB, the chief cause of skin reddening and sunburn, tends to damage the skin\'s more superficial epidermal layers. It plays a key role in the development of skin cancer and a contributory role in tanning and photoaging.',
        'Unfortunately, the very same UVB wavelengths (290-320 nanometers, or nm) that make the body synthesize vitamin D are also the wavelengths that produce sunburn and genetic mutations that can lead to skin cancer.'

    below50: [
        'UVAs increase your risk of skin cancer and causes photoaging of your skin.',
        'UVAs have a longer wavelength than UVB and can more easily penetrate the ozone layer and other obstacles (like clouds and pollution) on their way from the sun to the earth.',
        'When you are indoors and expose yourself to sunlight filtered through window glass, you are increasing your risk of a variety of conditions, primarily skin cancer, because the UVAs are effectively destroying your vitamin D3 levels while you\'re getting none of the benefits from UVB, and this can significantly increase your risk of skin cancer.',
        'While UVAs <i>will</i> give you a tan, unless the companion UVB rays are available you\'re likely doing more harm than good and should probably stay out of the sun to protect your skin.',
        'During the times of the year when UVB rays are not present where you live, you can take vitamin D3 supplements to prevent deficiency.',
        'A tan results from injury to the skin\'s DNA; the skin darkens in an imperfect attempt to prevent further DNA damage. These imperfections, or mutations, can lead to skin cancer.'

# To Use
Enable geolocation settings on your browser and/or device to allow the app to find the sun's current altitude at your position. Then click on the sun button (if you have not enabled geolocation it will ask).

* The first card will display the current date and time along with the sun's altitude and advice based on the results.
* The second card displays a forecast for the day. If the sun will reach 50 degrees above the horizon, it will tell you the time period.
* The third card generates helpful/fun facts based on the results from the first card.
